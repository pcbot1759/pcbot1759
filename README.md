👋 Hi, I’m @pcbot1759

👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity, red teaming, and finding vulnerabilities faster than they patch them.
🌱 I’m currently learning how to stay invisible in plain sight (aka advanced pen testing and threat hunting).
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that need a mix of stealth, creativity, and a Kali Linux toolkit.
📫 How to reach me: [Your Preferred Contact] — if you know where to look 😉
😄 Pronouns: [Your Pronouns]
⚡ Fun fact: I run Kali as my daily driver...and I still sleep with one eye open.
